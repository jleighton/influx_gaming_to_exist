# Influxdb to Exist.io Script #

Use this script to extract gaming time from an InfluxDB database and submit it to lifelogging application Exist.io.

If you're logging different things in InfluxDB, the script could easily be adapted.

See https://github.com/c99koder/personal-influxdb for the InfluxDB that inspired this code.
